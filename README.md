# DNA.XForms
DNA.XForms is an open source suite of Xamarin.Forms controls and services brought to you by Digital Nomad Apps.  Controls which are included (or plan to be included) are: Vector Speech Bubble, Image Speech Bubble, Rounded Frame, and a set of Drag and Drop controls 

The library is in ongoing development, but the following controls are already usable:
+ CappedImage (iOS only) - A subclass of the Xamarin.Forms Image control which allows specifying a scalable area in an image so that the image can be stretched
+ RoundedFrame (iOS only) - Similar to the Xamrin.Forms Frame control, but allows specifying a corner radius to customize the appearance

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

1. Create Android implementations for RoundedFrame, CappedImage, VectorSpeechBubble
2. Complete the ImageSpeechBubble implementation for iOS first, then Android
3. Drag and Drop controls for iOS first, and then Android

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
I will gratefully accept pull requests for bug fixes as well as for Windows Phone implementations of any of the controls.  
I have no plans at this stage to create Windows Phones implementations myself, but if someone else wants to, I will gladly accept.
